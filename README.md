# Welcome to R for Education Research!

#### [r-for-ed-2021.github.io](https://r-for-ed-2021.github.io./) will be your primary source for class lectures, instructions, and sample data.

This hands-on training covers how to use R, an open-source software package, for education research and modeling, with an emphasis on education finance data. Participants will: 

* Learn best practices for importing and cleaning data and processing it into datasets. 

* Develop techniques for answering common research questions. 

* Visualize the analysis, and export the results as static or interactive tables, plots, and maps. 

* Create an interactive notebook or dashboard to share results in a visually compelling way using R Shiny or RPubs. 

* Complete and visualize a data project through a capstone that uses R to tie together skills learned in the course. 


## Before the course

We will use RStudio to write in the R programming language in a more user-friendly way. In order to make sure you have plenty of time to trouble-shoot any technical issues before the workshop, please make sure that you **have R and RStudio installed on your computer by EOD Tuesday, June 1**. You can find instructions and links to install both [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html).  

After youâ€™ve installed R and R Studio, download this repository by clicking on the green **Code** button above and selecting *Download ZIP*.  The tests folder has 2 scripts that you should run to check your R and RStudio installation, and install the packages we will use in first class.  See the INSTRUCTIONS document in the tests folder for detailed instructions.
